## MLOps Example: TensorFlow Model with CI/CD
This project demonstrates how to set up a CI/CD pipeline for a TensorFlow ML model using GitHub Actions and CML (Continuous Machine Learning).

The workflow automates the entire ML pipeline:

- Training the model on each push or pull request
- Generating metrics and plots
- Publishing results and visualizations directly as comments in pull requests
