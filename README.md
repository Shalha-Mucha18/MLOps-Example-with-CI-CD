## MLOps Example: TensorFlow Model with CI/CD
This project demonstrates how to set up a CI/CD pipeline for a TensorFlow ML model using GitHub Actions and CML (Continuous Machine Learning).

The workflow automates the entire ML pipeline:

- Training the model on each push or pull request
- Generating metrics and plots
- Publishing results and visualizations directly as comments in pull requests

### Features
- Automated model training using TensorFlow
- Metrics logging (MAE & MSE) saved to metrics.txt
- Visualization of predictions using matplotlib
- CML-powered PR comments with plots and performance metrics.

## Setup

1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
cd <repo-name>
```
2. Install dependencies
``` bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run locally (optional)
```bash
python model.py
```
4. GitHub Secrets
   
- **Make sure the repo has GITHUB_TOKEN available (default in Actions)**
## GitHub Actions Workflow

The workflow file is at:
```bash
.github/workflows/cml.yml
```
### Demo

Hereâ€™s a sample PR comment generated by the pipeline:

```shell
## Model Metrics
Mean Absolute Error = 5.32
Mean Squared Error = 32.45

## Model Performance
